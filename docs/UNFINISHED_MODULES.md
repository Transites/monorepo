# Unfinished/Unused Modules Documentation

This document contains information about backend systems that were built but never implemented in the frontend UI. These are not deprecated per se, but rather unfinished features that could be implemented in the future.

## ⚠️ Important Notice

**These modules should be treated as invisible and should NOT be used or relied upon unless specifically instructed.** They exist in the codebase but are not connected to any UI components.

## Future Implementation Priority

If these features are to be implemented, suggested priority:

1. **Authentication System** - Foundation for admin features
2. **Basic Submission Forms** - Core user functionality  
3. **File Upload System** - Supporting functionality
4. **Token Workflow** - Enhanced user experience
5. **Admin Dashboard** - Management capabilities
6. **Author Dashboard** - User self-service

Each system is production-ready on the backend and just needs frontend implementation to become active.
